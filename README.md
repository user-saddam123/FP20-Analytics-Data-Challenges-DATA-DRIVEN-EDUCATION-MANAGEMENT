### Problem Statement 
[ðŸ”„ Home](#table-of-content)

The **Fort Vermilion School Division (FVSD)** is a governmental organization responsible for overseeing schools in the northwestern corner of Alberta, Canada. FVSD is renowned for their commitment to data-driven planning and decision-making to empower every student with equal opportunities and care in education.

#
### Project Background information:
[ðŸ”„ Home](#table-of-content)

The school year is split into 3 semesters (Fall, Winter and Spring). Each student is assessed each semester using three test (assessment) types - TOSREC, TOWRE and TOSWRF - using a standard score system. For each test, there is a known associated cost per student.

Based on the received score, students are split into groups indicating their performance level. Two types of grouping are used: 1) assessment level (very poor, at risk, good etc.) and 2) assessment level grouping (below average or average and above). Students with poor test results are required to take additional classes (Intervention groups), where each group contains 5 or 10 students depending on the test score, and requires additional teacher resources.

#
### Projects Challenge Objective
[ðŸ”„ Home](#table-of-content)

This challenge invites participants to delve deep into educational data and assist the School Division with strategic planning for assessments, comprehending student performance, and determining the necessary teacher resources for future enhancements.

#
### Dataset: 
[ðŸ”„ Home](#table-of-content)

Educational data related to student assessments, test scores, and associated costs.

#
### Collaboration: 
[ðŸ”„ Home](#table-of-content)

This challenge is brought to you in collaboration with ZoomCharts, integrating their exceptional Power BI solution to enhance your report creation skills.

#

### Tools Used:
[ðŸ”„ Home](#table-of-content)

In line with the objectives and project requirements, I have utilized **Power BI**, a powerful business intelligence tool, for dashboard creation.

#

### Dashboard Overview:
[ðŸ”„ Home](#table-of-content)

I have developed a Power BI dashboard consisting of **two pages** to meet the objectives of the challenge. The first page is based on **requested question**, and second page is **optional**.

## Questions & Solutions

[ðŸ”„ Home](#table-of-content)

#### Q1.Total number of students per each assessment level broken down by:
 * Semester (Fall, Winter, & Spring) 
 * School Year. 
 *  School

#### Solution:
One challenge I faced was that it was difficult to show data trends in a single visual with three different breakdowns. To solve this challenge, I added a filter slicer to the dashboard. The filter slicer allows users to select a specific semester, school year, and school.

To address this, I initially implemented a filter (slicer) to facilitate viewing data trends according to different breakdowns such as semester, school year, and school.

Below is the visual representing the Total number of students per each assessment level for the Spring Semester of the 2021/2022 School Year across all schools. With the applied filter, we observe the following:
 * Above Average Assessment level: **601 students**
 * Average Assessment level: **1512 students**
 * Below Average Assessment level: **707 students**
 * Good Assessment level: **330 students**
 * Poor Assessment level: **429 students**
 * Very Good Assessment level: **117 students**
 * Very Poor Assessment level: **272 students**

#### Q3. Percentage of students (calculated from the total number of students) per each assessment level broken down by: 
 * Semester (Fall, Winter, & Spring)
 * School Year
 * School

#### Solution:
Once Again it was difficult to show data trends in a single visual with three different breakdowns. To solve this challenge, I added a filter slicer to the dashboard. The filter slicer allows users to select a specific semester, school year, and school.

To address this, I initially implemented a filter (slicer) to facilitate viewing data trends according to different breakdowns such as semester, school year, and school.

Below is the visual representing the percentage of  Total number of students per each assessment level for the Spring Semester of the 2021/2022 School Year across all schools. With the applied filter, we observe the following:
 * Above Average Assessment level: **21.84%** students
 * Average Assessment level: **61.49%** students
 * Below Average Assessment level: **44.83%** students
 * Good Assessment level: **9.77%** students
 * Poor Assessment level: **32.76%** students
 * Very Good Assessment level: **2.87%** students
 * Very Poor Assessment level: **21.84%** students
